            <p>
                Hi there! I'm an associate computational biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital where I'm really grateful to be co-mentored by Profs. <a href="https://getzlab.org/">Gad Getz</a> and <a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/cancer-center/clinical-trials-and-research/center-for-cancer-research/investigators/rheinbay-lab">Esther Rheinbay</a>. My work currently focuses on computational cancer genomics, with a special focus on structural variation. Previously, I studied Computational Biology and Engineering at Brown, where I'm very lucky to have been advised by Prof. <a href="https://rsinghlab.org/">Ritambhara Singh</a>. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm also currently applying for PhD programs where I have the support of the <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/cise/graduate-fellowships">NSF CSGrad4US fellowship</a> ($159,000 total)!
            </p>

    <h2>Selected Other Projects</h2>
    <br>

    <h5><a href="/assets/files/Final_IS_Project_Report_Spring_2020.pdf">Neurophysiological Experiments Data Synchronization System</a></h5>
    For spring semester of my junior year in college, I had an independent study project where I developed a proof-of-concept system for data synchronization between video and various electrophysiological sensors for studies in Prof. David Borton's lab at Brown. I read in and decoded LTC signals from Timecode Systems devices on an Arduino and wrote software to test synchronization. I also resolved a problem in drift between GoPro and behavioral sensor data that had affected one of the lab's projects and had been unresolved for about a year.
    <br><br>

    <h5><a href="/assets/files/ScraperFinalPoster.pdf">Are.na Recommendation System</a></h5>
    For our final project in Brown's upper-level Data Science (CSCI 1951A) course, we developed a recommendation system for the art-sharing website Are.na using singular value decomposition. 
    <br><br>

    <h5>Histological Staining Quantification</h5>
    In Prof. Jill Helms' lab at Stanford as a rising college sophomore, upon seeing how long it took to manually quantify amount of histological staining on microscope slides, I created software using OpenCV to automatically quantify staining using color thresholds, which got used for a couple of the lab's projects. 
    <br><br>

    <h5><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyyMx0yzfJ4&ab_channel=XaviLoinaz">TheGunnApp</a></h5>
    Back in high school, I conceptualized and led the development and maintenance of an official school-sanctioned iOS app with useful features for my high school's community. It eventually got over 5,000 downloads and was regularly used by students, parents, and faculty. This was my first formative experience in seeing how immediate of an impact computational technologies I could develop could have on the people around me!

    <h2>Mentorship and Outreach</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        I love mentoring students and building both their enthusiasm and skills in research and academics! I have mentored three undergraduate students in Getz Lab, and used to be a classroom leader for the after-school volunteering program <a href="https://buddies4math.org/">Buddies4Math</a>.

        Additionally, I was part of the steering committee for RATalks, a group at the Broad Institute that hosts talks to the greater community. For this, I conceptualized and led planning of our very first <a href="/assets/files/RATalk_flyer.pdf">alumni RATalk</a> which sought to disseminate career and life perspective to the early-researcher community by a former associate director of the Broad Institute, increasing the availability of mentorship to junior researchers!

    <h2>Reading and Writing</h2>
    <br>
    I love to read and average around 30 books per year. What I love most about reading is how it enables better understanding of those around us and their perspectives. I think this is especially important in research, where this can help me to be a better collaborator and also to create a more welcoming environment to others from diverse backgrounds. Some of my favorite books are listed below:
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Free Food for Millionaires</i> by Min Jin Lee</li>
        <li><i>Everything I Never Told You</i> by Celeste Ng</li>
        <li><i>Little Failure</i> by Gary Shteyngart</li>
        <li><i>Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World</i> by Cal Newport</li>
        <li><i>Miracle Creek</i> by Angie Kim</li>
        <li><i>How to Know a Person: The Art of Seeing Others Deeply and Being Deeply Seen</i> by David Brooks</li>
        <li><i>Hunger: A Memoir of (My) Body</i> by Roxane Gay</li>
        <li><i>Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood</i> by Trevor Noah</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    Due in part to the perspectives I gained from my reading, I also wrote an <a href="https://tinyurl.com/xavi-nsf-csgrad4us-essay">essay</a> about how to increase diversity in computer science-related disciplines, which incidentally helped earn me $159,000 of funding for my PhD via the <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/cise/graduate-fellowships">NSF's CSGrad4US fellowship</a>.
